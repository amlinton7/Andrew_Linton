# Andrew Linton

I'm a graduate student at William & Mary pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics, building on my W&M undergraduate foundation in Finance and Accounting. Through professional experience in credit analysis and leveraged lending, I've developed a strong skillset for financial modeling and analysis. 

Beyond the numbers, I thrive in collaborative environmentsâ€”whether presenting investment recommendations, guiding new students as an Orientation Director, or leading teams as President of Alpha Kappa Psi. I'm driven by curiosity and problem-solving, and am always looking for ways to learn and grow.
